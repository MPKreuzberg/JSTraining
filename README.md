ACTIVITIES -----------------------------------------------------------------------
â€‹
Create an object called "myDay" that contains 2 properties:
- arrDays ( an array containing the days of the week in word )
- arrActivities ( an empty array )
â€‹
and 2 methods:
- dayOfTheWeek - ( using the date object you will have to extract the current day of the week in words! Tip: Use the arrDays as well! ) <br>
                    You will have to RETURN the day of the week. 
- addActivities - this method takes an array as a param and will print the following
<br> 
"Today is Monday and these are my activities ðŸ˜´,ðŸ‘• "
â€‹
<br>
â€‹
Once you are done, call the addActivities method ( outside the obj ) and pass an array with some emojis..( more emojis here https://getemoji.com/ )
<br>
Make sure you wrap the emojis in quotes.       
Example             
myDay.addActivities( [ "ï¿½ï¿½", "ï¿½ï¿½" ] );
